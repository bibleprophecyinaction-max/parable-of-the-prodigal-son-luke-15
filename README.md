# The Parable of the Father’s Heart – Luke 15

A younger son demanded his inheritance and left home for a far country.

After wasting everything, famine struck and he found himself feeding swine — broken, ashamed, and empty.

In his misery, he came to his senses and returned home in repentance.

While he was still far off, his father saw him, ran to him, embraced him, and restored him with:
- The best robe
- A ring
- Shoes
- A feast of celebration

This parable reveals the heart of God.

We are the prodigals.  
God waits with mercy and compassion.

There is great joy in heaven when a sinner repents.

Come home to the Father through Jesus Christ and receive forgiveness and new life.
